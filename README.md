# Emoji Language Flashcards

**NOTE:**

You do **NOT** need to be a software developer in order to help improve Emoji Flashcards!


## About

Emoji Language Flashcards are a set of emoji-translation-mp3 pairings that can be used to learn language vocabulary. Emoji Flashcards are meant to be used at the beginning of language learning, in order to give some confidence in vocabulary and to act as a supplement for additional more language-specific learning. These are not intended to be a list of "most common words", but rather are a list of pictographic words that are hopefully fairly translatable across many languages and cultures.

## Anki Deck

Our data is able to be formatted into Anki tsv files. These will be generated and cached on the fly by updated our data json files with the user's language (for categories).

### Note Template

We will also have a note template. Each data point has 3 different types of note:

1. Audio only (+ hidden hint)
2. Emoji only (No hint available)
3. Text only (No hint available)

The answer will always show all of Audio, Emoji, Text, and Hint:
