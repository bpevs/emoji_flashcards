# Emoji Flashcards

Flashcards for learning many languages. Inspiration for the set of cards is around the actual unicode Emoji spec, Gabriel Wyner's 625 words (particularly for verbs), frequency word lists, and HSK word lists.

Notice that these are not a list of the "most common words". This is a list of pictographic words that are hopefully fairly concrete across languages.

This is meant to be used at the very beginning of language learning, both to give some confidence in vocabulary and to act as a supplement for additional more language-specific learning.

### Usage

Make sure to install Deno: https://deno.land/manual/getting_started/installation

Then start the project:

```
deno task start
```

This will watch the project directory and restart as necessary.
