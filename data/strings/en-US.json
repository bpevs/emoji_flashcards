  "about-about-description": "Emoji Flashcards is an open-source project for generating Anki Flashcards. My goal has been to create a set of free flashcards that can be used across many languages. This way, we will have an easy place for beginners to start becoming aquainted to new vocabulary. I think pictographic flashcards are especially cool because you can learn new words without using your native language! Since emojis are a set of pictographic characters that are used mostly everywhere, it seemed like a natural way to go about this!",
  "about-help-description-1": "We use robots to help create our initial translations and transcriptions, so there are a lot of mistakes! If you help us fix our mistakes, our flashcards can be even more useful for everyone!",
  "about-help-description-2": "For translation errors, we'd love it if you could correct our translations on Github. If you don't have a Github account, want to help fix audio errors, or just want to hang out, you can join us on Discord!",
  "about-help-title": "Help us Translate",
  "about-sponsor-description": "Emoji Flashcards is a relatively low-cost project, so I think it should be feasible to stay free-of-charge forever. However, it does take time and energy to maintain, so if you want to help support this project, you can do so via Github Sponsors.",
